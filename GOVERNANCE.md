# Roles and responsibilities

This project has **users**, **contributors**, **core developers**, and a
**project lead**, and **security reviewers**.

## Users

People who use tidywater for water quality modeling are the most
important members of the community; without these users, this project
would have no purpose.

Users are encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the
community as much as possible. User contributions help ensure that the
project is satisfying users’ needs. Common user activities include (but
are not limited to):

- evangelising about the project
- asking and answering on community forums

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will
often find themselves becoming more and more involved. Such users may
then go on to become contributors, as described above.

## Contributors

Contributors interact with the project on GitHub by filing new issues,
improving existing issues, or submitting pull requests. Anyone can
become a contributor: there is no expectation of commitment to the
project, no required set of skills, and no selection process. The only
obligation is to follow the [code of
conduct](https://BrownandCaldwell-Public.github.io/tidywater/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Specific advice for contributing to the project can be found in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://BrownandCaldwell-Public.github.io/tidywater/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Core developers

Core developers are collectively responsible for day-to-day development
of the package, including responding to issues and reviewing pull
requests.

Changes are proposed as pull requests, and are only merged after they
have been reviewed by at least one other core developer. Changes to the
API (especially breaking changes) must also be approved by the project
lead.

The core developers of tidywater are: \* [Libby
McKenna](https://github.com/libbymckenna) \* [Riley
Mulhern](https://github.com/remulhern)

Core developers are recruited from contributors. An invitation to join
the core team can be extended to anyone who has made a major
contribution, either through a small number of large changes, or a
consistent pattern of smaller contributions. Any existing core developer
can propose a contributor be invited to the core team by emailing the
project lead. The project lead will the confirm the invitation with the
other core developers.

All core developers are bound by the [code of
conduct](https://BrownandCaldwell-Public.github.io/tidywater/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Project lead

The project lead, [Sierra Johnson](https://github.com/sierrajohnson), is
responsible for:

- Setting, and clearly communication the strategic objectives of the
  project.
- Mediating any conflicts amongst the core developers.
- Ensuring that the project survives in the long term.

The project lead is bound by the [code of
conduct](https://BrownandCaldwell-Public.github.io/tidywater/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Security reviewers

Security reviewers are the admins on the GitHub repo and represent Brown
and Caldwell’s Digital Services team. They are reponsible for reviewing
security concerns, updating permissions on the repo, and all pull
requests must be approved by one member of this team. To contact this
team with concerns, email: <CybersecReview@brwncald.com>

# Decision-making process

This project makes decisions according to a consensus model where
suggestions are considered and discussed between the community and core
developers, typically in GitHub issues. Where consensus cannot be
reached, the project lead’s word is final. If the community questions a
decision, the project lead may review it and either uphold or reverse
it.

Brown and Caldwell security reviewers may override decisions at any
time.
