# Changelog

## tidywater 0.10.0

CRAN release: 2025-08-24

### New features

- Revamped helpers `_df` replace `chain` and `once` functions. Use
  `pluck_cols = TRUE` to mimic `once` behavior, although it will always
  return a water column as well.
- Virus log removal added to `solvect_chlorine` based on the EPA
  Guidance Manual Table E-7 (1991)
- `modify_water` can now modify multiple water slots at once. Note that
  in order to modify multiple slots using `modify_water_df`, all input
  arguments must be included as a list.
- Acetic acid added as chemical to `chemdose_ph`. In addition to
  changing pH, dosing acetic acid will also update TOC and DOC of the
  input water.
- `regulate_toc` now available for calculating TOC removal compliance
- `gacrun_toc`, `gac_toc`, and `gacbv_toc` added to predict TOC removal
  from GAC treatment using either the EPA WTP model (2001) or the
  Zachman and Summers (2018) model. Different functions provide
  different output types: a data frame of the TOC breakthrough curve, a
  new water with updated TOC, DOC, and UV254 water slots, or the
  necessary bed volumes to stay below the target effluent TOC. See
  individual functions for documentation.
- `pluck_water` and `_df` helpers sped up by relying on base R instead
  of purrr
- `chemdose_toc` can now account for doc removal due to lime softening
  from the WTP Model (2001). To implement, use the `caoh2` argument.
- New model `opensys_ph` added to predict pH and alkalinity of an input
  water in an open carbonate system at equilibrium
- New function `plot_lead` added to graph the pH vs DIC contour plot for
  lead solubility
- Alkalinity slots added to the water class. `alk` and `alk_eq`
  represent the total alkalinity, and individual alkalinities due to
  carbonate, phosphate, ammonium, borate, silicate, and hypochlorite
  have been added as individual slots (eg. carbonate_alk_eq).

### Breaking changes

- `_chain` and `_once` functions have been deprecated. Replace with
  `_df` functions. Code should be similar, but has slightly different
  outputs.
- Default water naming in helper functions has been shortened to remove
  “\_water”. Eg, new default `output_water = "defined"`, old default
  `output_water = "defined_water"`. See function documentation for new
  defaults.
- Total alkalinity (`alk`) now accounts for phosphate, silicate, borate,
  hypochlorite, and ammonia. Could have a minor impact on final pH and
  alkalinity calculations in waters with those compounds.
- Now depends on R \>= 4.1.0 for built in pipe operator, `|>`

## tidywater 0.9.0

CRAN release: 2025-07-03

### New features

- New `chemdose_ph` chemicals: CaOCl2, CaSO4, HNO3, KMnO4, NaF, and
  Na3PO4
- New model `dissolve_cu` predicts the concentration of copper given pH,
  DIC, and phosphate based on the empirical model described in Lytle et
  al. (2018). `dissolve_cu_once` can also predict copper for waters in a
  data frame.
- `chemdose_dbp` can now input custom fitting coefficients as a data
  frame
- `chemdose_ph_once` and `chemdose_toc_once` are back and only return
  relevant waters slots in its output.
- `decarbonate_ph`: function to remove CO2 (H2CO3) from a water and
  determine the new pH (and division of ions)
- `modify_water`: function to modify individual slots in a water that
  handles unit conversions

### Breaking changes

- `applied_treatment` slot removed from water. Was not providing any
  benefit and added complexity. Should be the responsibility of the user
  to track.
- `h2co3` slot added to `water` class calculated based on {H} and total
  carbonate.
- `chemdose_ph` warns when ion water slots aren’t updated due to NA
  slots.
- `solvedose_ph` updated search range to allow for more water qualities
  without erroring. Updated search process results in slightly different
  outputs.
- `_toc` functions are DOC-based and previously assumed no particulate
  TOC removal. In reality, virtually all particulate TOC is removed with
  other particulates, so models have been updated to return TOC = DOC
- `chemdose_toc` custom coeff now accepts a data frame instead of a
  named list
- Corrosion index slots removed from `water` class.
- `calculate_corrosion` now outputs a data frame with the corrosion
  indices as columns. `calculate_corrosion_chain` removed because the
  base function has a numeric output.
- `calculate_corrosion` updated CCPP search range to allow for more
  water qualities without erroring.
- `solvect_o3` and `solveresid_o3` now return zero instead of NaN when
  the input dose is zero

## tidywater 0.8.2

CRAN release: 2025-05-17

- Reduce examples for CRAN speed again.

## tidywater 0.8.1

- Pare down examples and vignettes to speed up CRAN checks
- Minor updates to `chemdose_chloramine` warnings.

## tidywater 0.8.0

- `calculate_corrosion` expanded CCPP search range (fewer errors)

### Breaking changes

- Helper function (`_chain` and `_once`) behavior change: can now
  specify column name unquoted (eg, alum = AlumDose)
- Removed most (`_once`) helper functions because the desired output is
  almost never all water slots as columns. Refer to
  `pluck_water(parameter = "all")` for same behavior.
- `pac_toc` now constrained to accept a smaller range of doses and
  times. The form of the equation was allowing negative TOC outputs.
- `define_water`, `chemdose_ph`, `blend_waters`, and other pH related
  functions slightly impacted by a fix in concentration vs activity.
  Previous code assumed pH = 10^-\[H+\], code has been corrected to pH =
  10^-{H+}

### New features

- User may now choose which cation or anion to use for balancing ions
- dic now calculated in `define_water`
- dic now available in `convert_units`
- `chemdose_chloramine`: chloramine formation model given chlorine,
  ammonia, time
- `chemdose_chlordecay` now has argument, `use_chlorine_slot`. Function
  can now use chlorine dose and/or free_chlorine or combined_chlorine
  slots.

## tidywater 0.7.0

### New features

- chlorine and chloramine decay: `chemdose_chlordecay`

  `solvect` helpers now available.

### Breaking changes

- `chemdose_ct` renamed `solvect_chlorine`
- `ozonate_ct` renamed `solvect_o3`
- `tot_ocl` slot in water renamed `free_chlorine`
- `define_water` argument changes: `tot_ocl` changed to `free_chlorine`,
  added `combined_chlorine`
- Helper function (`_chain` and `_once`) behavior change: if multiple
  values are specified for multiple arguments, all combinations are
  used.
