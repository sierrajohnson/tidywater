# Dissociation constants and standard enthalpy for weak acids/bases

Equilibrium constants (k) and corresponding standard enthalpy of
reaction values (deltah) for significant acids in water influencing pH
at equilibrium. Includes carbonate, sulfate, phosphate, and
hypochlorite. Standard enthalpy of reaction is calculated by taking the
sum of the enthalpy of formation of each individual component minus the
enthalpy of formation of the final product. e.g., the standard enthalpy
of reaction for water can be calculated as: deltah_h2o = deltah_f_oh +
deltah_f_h - deltah_f_h2o = -230 + 0 - (-285.83) = 55.83 kJ/mol. See MWH
(2012) example 5-5 and Benjamin (2002) eq. 2.96.
