# Calculate new pH and ion balance after chemical addition

Calculates the new pH, alkalinity, and ion balance of a water based on
different chemical additions. For a single water use `chemdose_ph`; for
a dataframe use `chemdose_ph_df`. Use `pluck_cols = TRUE` to get values
from the output water as new dataframe columns. For most arguments in
the `_df` helper "use_col" default looks for a column of the same name
in the dataframe. The argument can be specified directly in the function
instead or an unquoted column name can be provided.

## Value

`chemdose_ph` returns a water class object with updated pH, alkalinity,
and ions post-chemical addition.

`chemdose_ph_df` returns a data frame containing a water class column
with updated pH, alkalinity, and ions post-chemical addition.

## Details

The function takes an object of class "water" created by
[define_water](https://BrownandCaldwell-Public.github.io/tidywater/reference/define_water.md)
and user-specified chemical additions and returns a new object of class
"water" with updated water quality. Units of all chemical additions are
in mg/L as chemical (not as product).

`chemdose_ph` works by evaluating all the user-specified chemical
additions and solving for what the new pH must be using
[uniroot](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/uniroot.html) to satisfy the principle
of electroneutrality in pure water while correcting for the existing
alkalinity of the water that the chemical is added to. Multiple
chemicals can be added simultaneously or each addition can be modeled
independently through sequential doses.

## Examples

``` r
water <- define_water(ph = 7, temp = 25, alk = 10)
#> Warning: Major ions missing and neither TDS or conductivity entered. Ideal conditions will be assumed. Ionic strength will be set to NA and activity coefficients in future calculations will be set to 1.
# Dose 1 mg/L of hydrochloric acid
dosed_water <- chemdose_ph(water, hcl = 1)
#> Warning: Chloride-containing chemical dosed, but cl water slot is NA. Slot not updated because background cl unknown.

# Dose 1 mg/L of hydrochloric acid and 5 mg/L of alum simultaneously
dosed_water <- chemdose_ph(water, hcl = 1, alum = 5)
#> Warning: Chloride-containing chemical dosed, but cl water slot is NA. Slot not updated because background cl unknown.
#> Warning: Sulfate-containing chemical dosed, but so4 water slot is NA. Slot not updated because background so4 unknown.

# Softening:
water2 <- define_water(ph = 7, temp = 25, alk = 100, tot_hard = 350)
#> Warning: Missing values for calcium and magnesium but total hardness supplied. Default ratio of 65% Ca2+ and 35% Mg2+ will be used.
#> Warning: Major ions missing and neither TDS or conductivity entered. Ideal conditions will be assumed. Ionic strength will be set to NA and activity coefficients in future calculations will be set to 1.
dosed_water2 <- chemdose_ph(water2, caco3 = -100, softening_correction = TRUE)

example_df <- water_df %>%
