# tidywater: Water Quality Models for Drinking Water Treatment Processes

Provides multiple water chemistry-based models and published empirical
models in one standard format. As many models have been included as
possible, however, users should be aware that models have varying
degrees of accuracy and applicability. To learn more, read the
references provided below for the models implemented. Functions can be
chained together to model a complete treatment process and are designed
to work in a 'tidyverse' workflow. Models are primarily based on these
sources: Benjamin, M. M. (2002, ISBN:147862308X), Crittenden, J. C.,
Trussell, R., Hand, D., Howe, J. K., & Tchobanoglous, G., Borchardt, J.
H. (2012, ISBN:9781118131473), USEPA. (2001)
