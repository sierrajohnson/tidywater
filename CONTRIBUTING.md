# Contributing to tidywater

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the tidywater package!
This guide includes some best practices to help prepare your
contribution. This guide is adapted from the tidyverse contribution
guide. We will also generally adhere to the tidyverse [code review
principles](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/).

First and foremost, we don’t wnat you to be intimidated by this process!
If you don’t understand the steps in this guide, reach out to the
maintainers on the [issues
page](https://github.com/BrownandCaldwell-Public/tidywater/issues) and
we will help get you started. We believe all tidywater users can make
valuable contributions, even those who are new to R and new to package
development.

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the
documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the
changes are made in the *source* file. This generally means you’ll need
to edit [roxygen2
comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`,
not a `.Rd` file. You can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by
reading the comment in the first line of the `.Rd` file.

## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it’s a good idea to first file an
issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed. If
you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a
minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also
help you write a unit test, if needed). See tidyverse guide on [how to
create a great issue](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/) for
more advice.

- [Code style](#code-style)

### Files and naming conventions

- `R/` - R source code files.
  - File name will typically match the name of the function (`_chain`
    and `_once` helper functions are in the same file as the baseline
    function. If you can’t find the file for the function you want to
    modify, try GitHub’s search function.
  - Model functions follow the naming convention:
    “treatmentapplied_modelapplied”
- `tests/` - Test files.
  - Each `R/` file should have a corresponding test file. Create this
    file by opening the `R/` file and running usethis::use_test() in
    your console.
  - For help writing tests, look at the existing tests or read the
    documentation of the `testthat` package.
- `data-raw/compile_tidywater_data` - R code used to generate data files
  for the package.
  - If new data are added to the package, a corresponding `usethis`
    function must be run to generate the `.rda` file.
  - For security and transparency reasons, data files that can not be
    re-created with scripts in the `data-raw` folder cannot be accepted
    in the package.
- `vignettes/` - Vignettes for the package
  - All vignettes are generated with `.Rmd` files.
- `man/` - Roxygen documentation files automatically generated by
  `devtools::document()`

### Pull request process

- Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven’t done
  this before, we recommend using
  `usethis::create_from_github("BrownandCaldwell-Public/tidywater", fork = TRUE)`.

- Install all development dependencies with
  [`pak::local_install_dev_deps()`](https://pak.r-lib.org/reference/local_install_dev_deps.html),
  and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running
  `devtools::check()`. Also run `devtools::document()` to make sure you
  have everything needed to update documentation. If these don’t run
  cleanly or produce changes, it’s a good idea to ask for help before
  continuing.

- Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using
  `usethis::pr_init("brief-description-of-change")`.

- Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running
  `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser. The
  title of your PR should briefly describe the change. The body of your
  PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.

- For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md`
  (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in
  <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>. At minimum include your
  GitHub user name and the issue numbers being resolved. For example:

  - Add warning to `chemdose_dbp` when input water is outside model
    range (#12, @username)

### Code style

- New code should follow the tidyverse [style
  guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). You can use the
  [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply
  these styles, but please don’t restyle code that has nothing to do
  with your PR.

- We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
  [Markdown
  syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html),
  for documentation.

- We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for
  unit tests. Contributions with test cases included are easier to
  accept.
