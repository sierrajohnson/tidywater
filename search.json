Even , successfully created first water class! can view first slots water class can contain printing empty_water. slots general parameters, carbon content, corrosivity indicators, major cations anions, disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Different functions within tidywater allow model parameters . let’s add things water already know. Let’s say know pH, alkalinity, temperature, sodium concentration. can define parameters arguments define_water, accepts pH (unitless), alkalinity units mg/L CaCO3, temperature degrees C, ions mg/L (exception bromide manganese, reported ug/L). function also refers chemical compounds chemical symbol formula. Let’s call new water class my_water. Notice slots ph, alk, temp, na, ca now populated, ’ll need use slot names see information. ions slots (na, ca) output units mol/L (M). can also see define_water automatically calculated amount carbonate (co3) bicarbonate (hco3) water based alkalinity pH. can easily summarize water quality using summarize_wq function, takes water class object exports easy--read table water quality console. great way get started tidywater users need model single water quality. large data set multiple water qualities want model, though, might sound tedious. wouldn’t possible manually enter pH, alkalinity, temperature, etc. , let’s say, 5,000 rows. Instead, tidywater helper functions generate many water classes simultaneously imported data set.
