# Helper Functions & Dose Chemicals

This vignette assumes a basic understanding of `define_water` and the S4
`water` class. See
[`vignette("intro", package = "tidywater")`](https://BrownandCaldwell-Public.github.io/tidywater/articles/intro.md)
for more information.

## Chemical dosing setup

To showcase tidywater’s acid-base equilibrium functions, let’s use a
common water treatment problem. In this analysis, a hypothetical
drinking water utility wants to know how much their pH will be impacted
by varying doses of alum. They also want to ensure that their finished
water has a pH of 8.

We can create a quick model by manually inputting the utility’s typical
water quality. Then we’ll dose the water with their typical alum dose of
30 mg/L, and then a proposed 20mg/L dose. Finally, we’ll see how much
caustic is required to raise the pH back to 8.

``` r
# Use define_water to prepare for tidywater analysis
no_alum_water <- define_water(ph = 8.3, temp = 18, alk = 150)

# Dose 30 mg/L of alum
alum_30 <- no_alum_water %>%
  chemdose_ph(alum = 30) %>%
  solvedose_ph(target_ph = 8, chemical = "naoh")

alum_30 # Caustic dose required to raise pH to 8 when 30 mg/L of alum is added
># [1] 10.3

# Dose 20 mg/L of alum
alum_20 <- no_alum_water %>%
  chemdose_ph(alum = 20) %>%
  solvedose_ph(target_ph = 8, chemical = "naoh")

alum_20 # Caustic dose required to raise pH to 8 when 20 mg/L of alum is added
># [1] 6.2
```

As expected, a lower alum dose requires a lower caustic dose to reach
the target pH.

Note: How can you remember the difference between `solvedose_ph` vs
`chemdose_ph`? Any function beginning with “solve” is named for what it
is solving for based on one input: SolveWhatItReturns_Input. So,
`solvedose_ph` is solving for a dose based on a target pH.

Other treatment functions are set up as
WhatHappensToTheWater_WhatYouSolveFor. So with `chemdose_ph`, chemicals
are being dosed, and we’re solving for the resulting pH (and other
components of acid/base chemistry). `chemdose_toc` models the resulting
TOC after chemicals are added, and `dissolve_pb` calculates lead
solubility in the distribution system.

## Multi-scenario setup and intro to `_df` functions

But what if the utility wants to test a variety of alum doses on a range
of their water quality? Here, we’ll use the power of tidywater’s `_df`
functions to extend this analysis to a full dataframe.

We’ll use tidywater’s built-in water quality data, `water_df`, then
apply `define_water_df` to convert the data in the dataframe to a
`water` object in one column of the dataframe. We use `define_water_df`
so that other models can be added to the dataframe. This function takes
a dataframe input, then outputs all parameters in a `water` class
column. This is true for all tidywater functions with the `_df` suffix.
`_df` functions are handy in a piped code block where you’ll need to use
many tidywater functions, such as `chemdose_ph`, `chemdose_toc`, etc.
After applying `define_water_df`, we’ll also use `balance_ions_df` to
create a new variable with the ions balanced for all the “raw” `water`
objects in the dataframe.

We’ll also set a range of alum doses to see how they affect each water
quality scenario.

``` r
# Set a range of alum doses

alum_doses <- tibble(alum_dose = seq(20, 60, 10))

# use tidywater's built-in synthetic data water_df, for this example
raw_water <- water_df %>%
  slice_head(n = 2) %>%
  define_water_df(output_water = "raw") %>%
  balance_ions_df(input_water = "raw") %>%
  # join alum doses to create several dosing scenarios
  cross_join(alum_doses)
```

## `chemdose_ph_df` and `pluck_water`

Now that we’re set up, let’s dose some alum! To do this, we’ll use
`chemdose_ph_df`, a function with the `_df` suffix introduced earlier
but whose tidywater base is `chemdose_ph`. The `chemdose_ph_df` function
requires dosed chemicals to match the argument’s notation or have to be
specified when calling the the function. Most tidywater chemicals are
named with their chemical formula, all lowercase and no special
characters.

There are two ways to dose chemicals.

1.  You can pass an appropriately named column into the function, or

2.  You can specify the chemical in the function.

Let’s look at both options using the alum doses from before, and adding
hydrochloric acid. You should notice that the ouputs of both methods are
the same.

``` r
# 1. Use existing column in data frame to dose a chemical
dose_water <- raw_water %>%
  mutate(hcl = 5) %>%
  chemdose_ph_df(input_water = "raw", alum = alum_dose, pluck_cols = TRUE) %>%
  pluck_water(input_water = "raw", parameter = "ph") %>%
  select(-c(raw, dosed_chem))

head(dose_water)
>#                                                 balanced alum_dose hcl

># 6          6.93       62.87537    8.5

# 2. Dose a chemical in the function
dose_water <- raw_water %>%
  chemdose_ph_df(input_water = "raw", alum = alum_dose, hcl = 5) %>%
  pluck_water(input_water = c("raw", "dosed_chem"), parameter = "ph") %>%
  select(-c(raw, dosed_chem))

head(dose_water)
>#                                                 balanced alum_dose hcl raw_ph
># 1 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>        20   5    7.9
># 2 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>        30   5    7.9
># 3 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>        40   5    7.9
># 4 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>        50   5    7.9
># 5 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>        60   5    7.9
># 6 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>        20   5    8.5
>#   dosed_chem_ph
># 1          6.60
># 2          6.42
># 3          6.25
># 4          6.07
># 5          5.87
># 6          6.93
```

Notice in the above code that we used the `pluck_water` helper function.
This function creates a new column for one selected parameter from a
`water` class object. You can choose which `water` column to pluck from
using the `input_water` argument. Next, select the parameter of interest
(which must match the water slot’s name). Finally, the output column’s
name will default to the form `water_parameter`, but there is an option
to name it yourself using the `output_column` argument. We can also
directly pull out the output from a model function into its own column
with `pluck_cols = TRUE` so that you don’t need to apply `pluck_water`
later.

## `solvedose_ph_df`

Remember, our original task is to see how alum addition affects the pH,
but the finished water pH needs to be 8. First, we’ll use caustic to
raise the pH to 8. `solvedose_ph_df` uses `solvedose_ph` to calculate
the required chemical dose (as chemical, not product) based on a target
pH. Similar to `chemdose_ph_df`, `solvedose_ph_df` can handle chemical
selection and target pH inputs as a column or function arguments.

``` r
solve_ph <- raw_water %>%
  chemdose_ph_df("raw", alum = alum_dose) %>%
  mutate(target_ph = 8) %>%
  solvedose_ph_df(input_water = "dosed_chem", chemical = c("naoh", "mgoh2")) %>%
  select(-c(raw, dosed_chem))

head(solve_ph)
>#                                                 balanced alum_dose target_ph
># 1 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>        20         8
># 2 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>        30         8
># 3 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>        40         8
># 4 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>        50         8
># 5 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>        60         8
># 6 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>        20         8
>#   chemical dose
># 1     naoh  8.3
># 2     naoh 12.3
># 3     naoh 16.5
># 4     naoh 20.5
># 5     naoh 24.4
># 6     naoh  6.3
```

Now that we have the dose required to raise the pH to 8, let’s dose
caustic into the water!

``` r
dosed_caustic_water <- raw_water %>%
  chemdose_ph_df(input_water = "raw", output_water = "alum_dosed", alum = alum_dose) %>%
  solvedose_ph_df(input_water = "alum_dosed", target_ph = 8, chemical = "naoh") %>%
  chemdose_ph_df(input_water = "alum_dosed", output_water = "caustic_dosed", naoh = dose) %>%
  pluck_water(input_water = "caustic_dosed", "ph") %>%
  select(-c(raw:balanced, alum_dosed))

head(dosed_caustic_water)
>#   alum_dose target_ph chemical dose
># 1        20         8     naoh  8.3
># 2        30         8     naoh 12.3
># 3        40         8     naoh 16.5
># 4        50         8     naoh 20.5
># 5        60         8     naoh 24.4
># 6        20         8     naoh  6.3
>#                                            caustic_dosed caustic_dosed_ph
># 1 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>             7.99
># 2 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>             7.98
># 3 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>             8.00
># 4 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>             8.02
># 5 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>             8.01
># 6 <S4 class 'water' [package "tidywater"] with 75 slots>             7.99
```

You can see the resulting pH from dosing caustic has raised the pH to 8
+/- 0.02 SU. Doses are rounded to the nearest 0.1 mg/L to make the
calculations go a little faster.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we were introduced to tidywater helper functions
`_df`, which can be used to apply base functions to a dataframe. We also
used the `pluck_water` helper function and the `pluck_cols` argument to
extract parameters of interest from our dataframes.

We implemented these helper functions to complete an example dosing
water with coagulant (alum) and adjusting the resulting pH to a target
pH of 8 using `solvedose_ph` and `chemdose_ph` functions. To try another
example with helper functions and learn about the `blend_waters`
function, see `vignette("blend_waters", package = "tidywater")`.
